Deploy a Web Application using Podman Container

### DESCRIPTION: ###

Deploying a web application using Podman containers streamlines the deployment process by encapsulating the application and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can be easily deployed across various environments, from local machines to production servers. Podman's flexibility enables seamless deployment and management, while its security features ensure the protection of deployed applications. Overall, leveraging Podman for web application deployment offers a modern, efficient, and secure approach to managing application infrastructure. 

### OVERVIEW OF PODMAN CONTAINERS: ###

Podman containers offers several services, including: 
1. Container Management: Podman offers a comprehensive set of commands for managing containers, including creating, starting, stopping, and removing containers. Developers can easily manage container lifecycle operations using Podman's intuitive command-line interface. 2. Image Management: Podman provides tools for managing container images, including pulling images from registries, building custom images from Dockerfiles or Podmanfiles, and pushing images to registries. Podman's image management capabilities ensure efficient distribution and sharing of containerized applications. 
3.	Compatibility: Podman is fully compatible with Docker container images and Dockerfiles, allowing users to leverage existing Docker-based workflows seamlessly. Podman's compatibility with Docker enables easy migration of applications to Podman containers without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructure. 
4.	Security: Podman prioritizes security by design, providing features such as rootless containers and user namespaces to isolate containers from the host system. This enhances the security of containerized applications and mitigates the risk of security breaches 

### GOAL: ###

1.	Ensure the web application runs consistently across different environments using Podman containers.  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	       
2.	Optimize resource utilization and scaling capabilities of the web application with Podman.
3. Prioritize isolation and security features of Podman to protect the deployed web application.
 	 
 
### HARDWARE REQUIREMENT: ### 

For deploying a web application using Podman containers, the hardware requirements are relatively modest. At a minimum, you need a machine capable of running a Linux operating system, as Podman is primarily designed for Linux environments. Generally, a standard server with sufficient CPU, like Intel i5, RAM of size 4GB to 16 GB depending on organisation size, and storage capacity is required to host the container engine.         
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	     
### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: ### 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	     
1.	Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	     
2.	Podman Package 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 

### PROCEDURE: ###

containerization has revolutionized the way applications are deployed and managed, offering a lightweight and scalable solution to software development and deployment. Among the various containerization platforms available, Podman has emerged as a powerful tool for managing containers in a secure and efficient manner, especially for organizations seeking flexibility and control over their containerized environments. 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	              
This guide will explore the process of deploying a web application using Podman containers. Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your deployment workflow or an IT professional tasked with managing containerized applications, understanding how to leverage Podman effectively can significantly enhance your deployment process.
In this introductory section, we'll briefly discuss what Podman is and highlight its advantages for container orchestration. Then, we'll outline the steps involved in deploying a web application using Podman containers, providing you with a roadmap for the rest of this guide. Let's dive in.
